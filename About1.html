    <p style="color: blue;">Affiliate marketing is a form of online marketing where you earn a commission for referring customers to a merchant’s website. You do this by creating content that showcases the benefits of the merchant’s product or service and includes a special link that tracks your referrals. When someone clicks on your link and makes a purchase, you get paid a percentage of the sale.</p>
    <p style="color: blue;">Affiliate marketing is a win-win situation for both parties involved. The merchant gets more exposure and sales for their product or service, while you get to earn passive income without having to create or deliver the product or service yourself.</p>
    <h3 style="color: brown;">How Does Affiliate Marketing Works?</h3>

     <p style="color: blue;">Affiliate marketing involves four main players, who each play a unique part in the marketing process:</p>
     <ul>
        <li style="color: blue;">The affiliate (or “publisher”): The individual or entity that promotes the merchant’s product or service</li>
        <li style="color: blue;">The merchant: The individual or entity selling the product or service that the affiliate promotes</li>
        <li style="color: blue;">The affiliate network: An intermediary between an affiliate and a merchant’s affiliate program</li>
        <li style="color: blue;">The customer: The person who buys the product or service from the merchant’s website after clicking on the affiliate’s link</li>
     </ul>
     <h3 style="color: brown;">The affiliate marketing process can be summarized as follows:</h3>
     <ul>
        <li style="color: blue;">You join an affiliate program or network and choose a product or service to promote.</li>
        <li style="color: blue;">You get a unique affiliate link that identifies you as the referrer.</li>
        <li style="color: blue;">You create content (such as a blog post, a video, a social media post, etc.) that features the product or service and includes your affiliate link.</li>
        <li style="color: blue;">You share your content with your audience and drive traffic to the merchant’s website.</li>
        <li style="color: blue;">When someone clicks on your affiliate link and makes a purchase or completes an action, you earn a commission.</li>
     </ul>
     <h3 style="color: brown;">3 types of affiliate marketing</h3>
     <p style="color: blue;">There are different types of affiliate marketing depending on the payment model and the relationship between the merchant and the affiliate. Here are the most common ones:</p>
     <ul>
        <li style="color: blue;">Pay-per-sale: This is the most common type of affiliate marketing, where you earn a commission for each sale that you generate. The commission rate can vary depending on the product or service and the affiliate program or network. For example, Amazon Associates pays up to 10% commission for each sale, while Shopify pays up to 200% commission for each new customer.</li>
        <li style="color: blue;">Pay-per-lead: This is a type of affiliate marketing where you earn a commission for each lead that you generate. A lead is a potential customer who shows interest in the merchant’s product or service by providing their contact information or signing up for a free trial. The commission rate can vary depending on the quality and quantity of the leads and the affiliate program or network. For example, HubSpot pays up to $1,000 commission for each qualified lead, while Bluehost pays $65 commission for each new customer.</li>
        <li style="color: blue;">Pay-per-click: This is a type of affiliate marketing where you earn a commission for each click that you generate. A click is when someone clicks on your affiliate link and visits the merchant’s website. The commission rate can vary depending on the traffic and the affiliate program or network. For example, Google AdSense pays based on the number and value of the clicks, while ClickBank pays up to 75% commission for each sale.</li>
